EVE Camera – Open-Source CAD Files 

We’re releasing the full EVE Camera CAD files as open source and free to use. These files are intended to support learning, modification, repair, and further development by the community. Feel free to study, adapt, and build upon the designs.

Print Settings:
I would recommend to use lower layer height for better quality for example 0.16mm is what we used for our project.
Recommended Wall count is 4-5.
Infill density is 35-45%
Filament Type: We used PLA but anything you can print with your machine works well.
Additionaly ironing for Top most Surfaces can be enabled for better top layer quality, make sure this option is calibrated for your printer and filament used.
